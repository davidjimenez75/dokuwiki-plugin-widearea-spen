# Widearea Plugin for DokuWiki


This plugin uses the [WideArea JavaScript and CSS library](https://github.com/usablica/widearea)
 to add an expanded text edit field in the DokuWiki editor. You can see a demo 
 [here](https://usablica.github.io/widearea/). Once you install this plugin, you 
 will get a faded gray `X` in the top right of the edit field.
